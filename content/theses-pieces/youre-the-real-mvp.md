Within this concept of design thinking, there's something called the "Minimum Viable Product." You can read a good overview of this idea on Wikipedia:

Here's the part we're wanting to call attention to:

> "A minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more."

When you're creating something for the world, it's really easy to keep adding features, bells, and whistles, and spending so much time perfecting it that you never end up "shipping" it (publishing it).

If we swap "product" out for "project", we have something we can work with in SJMD Land, where paralysis-via-perfection is certainly something we're up against.

An MVP is any project we create and roll out to our communities that is done _enough_ to work, but that we know we will iterate on, improve, tweak, and evolve in response to how well it advances equity, creates community, undermines dogma, etc.

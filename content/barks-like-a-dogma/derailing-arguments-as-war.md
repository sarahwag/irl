A lot of us are uncomfortable with arguments, because we have only seen them in the adversarial context. We see the as fighting, attacking, provoking. Even if that's not _you_, it's bound to be a lot of people in your IRL community.

Talk through (accountabilibuddy or journal) what arguments-as-war tendencies you've noticed IRL. Try to pinpoint at least one tactic, intervention, or proactive strategy you can use to switch rails: moving that train from argument-as-war to argument-as-proof. The catch: it has to be something you, personally, would actually use (not some ideal, "in a perfect world"-type scenario).

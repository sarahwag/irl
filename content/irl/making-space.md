In your real life, right now, you're connected to people and institutions and ideas and histories in ways that are unique to you. How SJD shows up in your world is _at least a little_ different from how it shows up in ours. Your world is comprised of passions, urgencies, needs, frictions, and more that are localized to you, and the people surrounding you.

SJMD is a space that we made for you/us to learn about, discuss, and work through dogmatic tendencies within social justice. It's a space we all now share, that we're actively co-creating together.

In order to take SJMD IRL, you'll have to do something similar: create a space for _your_ real community to work through all the issues that resonated with you throughout this course. 

A meetspace, if you will, that will likely combine elements of cyberspace and physical space, for your community to exist in this way.

**Throughout this Module, we'll be talking about what that might look like, how the different Modules so far might frame your efforts, and providing some examples of how people are already doing this in their communities.**

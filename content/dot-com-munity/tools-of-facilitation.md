We don't know of a better "tool" when it comes to creating real community than the process of facilitation. But that's a big can of worms (a [nuanced skill,](http://www.facilitating.xyz/chapter-1-unlocking-magic-facilitation-understanding-facilitation-nuanced-skill/) if you will).

So let's narrow our focus down to two things within facilitation. Following are links to a couple of short chapters from Sam & Meg's book [_Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29012097-unlocking-the-magic-of-facilitation?from_search=true) (to which you have full access via the downloads in your [Memberful dashboard](https://sjmd.memberful.com/auth/sign_in)):

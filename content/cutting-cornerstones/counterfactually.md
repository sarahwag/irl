If you remember, we introduced Cornerstones of SJD in addition to the tenets because we saw the naming and taming of tenets quickly becoming a game of Whack-a-Mole.

The cornerstones, being the foundational principles that support the tenets, are a more confrontable problem. Take one away and countless tenets suddenly fall apart.

**Counterfactuals are a specific tool, used in addition to argument-as-proof, that can help us know if a cornerstone is a cornerstone.** Because all we need to ask is "If this didn't exist, would other tenets of SJD suddenly make less sense?"

Or, "If we were to remove this cornerstone, would we able to productively challenge other tenets of SJD?"

If the answer is "yes," we have a cornerstone. If the answer is, "Well, actually... no," then we don't.

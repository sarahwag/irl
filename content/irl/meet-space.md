Originating in cyberpunk novels, ["meatspace"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace) is a fun (and kinda gross) way to describe life outside the internet. Offline life. Physical space, not cyberspace.

It's a useful term, differentiating from IRL ("in real life"), because it calls attention to the truth that online life _is part of_ "real" life -- truer than ever in our increasingly connected, social-media-mediated lives.

In this Module, we'll be using IRL in a both/and way, talking about everyone we've met, or might eventually meet -- both online and in-person -- who makes up our [_real_ community](https://dotcommunity.course.sjmd.space/hail-mary/what-is-real-community/), or might be part of it someday. If we wanted to be cute, we could call it our "meetspace".

In that way, we'll all have a meetspace that's unique to us.

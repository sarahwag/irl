The Acolytes Module, and a lot of what we're discussing in this Module now, could be summed up as "Trigger City. Population: Us." We mean this in two ways.

In order to address things like guilt and shame, prestige, our own complicity in problematic tendencies, graceful ways to address others' involvement in the same, and the whole messy hot ball of wax that is SJD, we need to be aware of our personal triggers, and find ways to navigate them without melting down.

Mindfulness is a powerful tool that can help us do that.

We will also benefit from cultivating [mindfulness triggers](https://www.wildmind.org/applied/daily-life/mindfulness-triggers), little notes-to-self (sometimes literally) that remind us to "break out of automatic pilot" and come back to the moment. (read more about that [here](https://www.wildmind.org/applied/daily-life/mindfulness-triggers))

We need to be able to remember this tool exists, when, for example, we're arguing-as-war (instead of arguing-as-proof), or someone's counterfactual turns into a shouting contest.

And we've by no means turned over every stone.

For every essay we linked, there were 3 others we could have instead. For every chapter of a book we recommended, there's the rest of the book that would likely benefit us all to read. And so on.

This course might be coming to an end for you, but by no means is SJMD over. It's just getting started.

Just like we had an "Orientation" Module, you'll get the chance to go through "Graduation", where we'll talk about some of the opportunities we have to address these unturned stones in the future.

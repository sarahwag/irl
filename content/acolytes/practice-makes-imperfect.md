Vipassana isn't goal-oriented (e.g., we're not trying to have a "perfectly calm mind"). Indeed, pursuit of perfection is antithetical to Vipassana, or mindfulness-oriented meditation.

But we still need to practice.

```
Sit for at least 5 minutes (ideally right now, or before moving on with this Module), in Vipassana meditation. You can use one of the guided meditations we linked from Calm, google around, or go zero tech -- your call. We just want you to practice this (at least) once before we move on.
```

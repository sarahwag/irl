How easy would it be for any conversation about SJD to devolve into an argument-as-war about a particular tenet?

On the flipside, how productive would it be if we could evolve that conversation into an argument-as-proof about a particular tenet?

The answer to both of those rhetorical questions is "[hella.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hella)"

We can't spot tenets of SJD, and truly determine they _are_ or _aren't_ a tenet, without argument-as-proof as a tool. And any slippage into argument-as-war (or argument-as-performance) only sets us back, reifies other aspects of dogma, or fuels fundamentalism.

### Module 6
# Dot-Com-Munity IRL

How can we take what we covered in [Dot-Com-Munity](https://1.course.sjmd.space) and apply it IRL?

<small>If you need a refresher on what we talked about in Dot-Com-Munity, we suggest you [revisit the Module](https://1.course.sjmd.space) and quickly skim through it for a snapshot (remember, you can use the right arrow key on your keyboard for quick browsing). The same goes for the rest of the Modules, which we'll link to at the beginning of their topic.</small>

Each of the proposed theses in Theses Pieces are MVPs.

They're surely going to iterated upon (based on the feedback you already gave, insights you glean when you try to take them into your real world, etc.), and might be thrown out entirely, but they were viable enough that we thought they were worthwhile to share with you. We felt like we could do something meaningful with them.

As you start to consider what you might do differently IRL as a result of SJMD, we want you to dream big (as big as you feel compelled to dream), but plan minimally:

```
Talk through with your accountabilibuddy, or draft up in a journal, what an MVP (minimum viable project) might look like for you, as something that you can (co-)create to bring SJMD IRL. What minimum steps, actions, creation, or planning are absolutely necessary before you can meaningfully share that with your community, knowing that you can in the future iterate, improve, or change directions entirely based on input?
```

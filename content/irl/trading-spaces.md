But worry not! This isn't us kindly "showing you the door."

We'll be relying on the space we've already created, the SJMD.space, for continued support, encouragement, ideation, and vetting as we move forward -- separately, but together.

You might find yourself bouncing between spaces -- the space you're creating or occupying IRL, and the space we're co-creating here -- bringing insight from one to the other, and back again. And that's just great!

**Once you complete the course, you might find the [SJMD Community](https://community.sjmd.space) to be a helpful resource (if you're not already a member). We'd love to here what you're looking for on that front.**

<small>Help us prepare the Community for your potential arrival. What do you see yourself needing from us? How might we orient the community to be meaningful space for you as you do SJMD IRL?</small>

Offline life. Physical space, not cyberspace.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a useful term, differentiating from IRL (\u0026ldquo;in real life\u0026rdquo;), because it calls attention to the truth that online life is part of \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; life \u0026ndash; truer than ever in our increasingly connected, social-media-mediated lives.\nIn this Module, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using IRL in a both/and way, talking about everyone we\u0026rsquo;ve met, or might eventually meet \u0026ndash; both online and in-person \u0026ndash; who makes up our real community, or might be part of it someday. If we wanted to be cute, we could call it our \u0026ldquo;meetspace\u0026rdquo;.\nIn that way, we\u0026rsquo;ll all have a meetspace that\u0026rsquo;s unique to us.\n"},{"uri":"https://irl.course.sjmd.space/","title":"SJMD IRL","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Module 6 SJMD IRL Guiding Questions:  How do we bring SJMD to our IRL communities?

How SJD shows up in your world is at least a little different from how it shows up in ours. Your world is comprised of passions, urgencies, needs, frictions, and more that are localized to you and the people surrounding you.\nSJMD is a space that we made to learn about, discuss, and work through dogmatic tendencies within social justice. It\u0026rsquo;s a shared space that we\u0026rsquo;re actively co-creating together.\nIn order to take SJMD IRL, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to do something similar: create a space for your real community to work through all the issues that resonated with you throughout this course.\nA meetspace, if you will, that will likely combine elements of cyberspace and physical space, for your community to exist in this way.\nThroughout this Module, we\u0026rsquo;ll be talking about what that might look like, how the different Modules so far might frame your efforts, and providing some examples of how people are already doing this in their communities.\n"},{"uri":"https://irl.course.sjmd.space/barks-like-a-dogma/","title":"Barks Like a Dogma","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Module 6 Barks Like a Dogma IRL How can we take what we covered in Barks Like a Dogma and apply it IRL?\n"},{"uri":"https://irl.course.sjmd.space/irl/trading-spaces/","title":"Trading Spaces","tags":[],"description":"","content":"But worry not!

Cohen   \u0026ldquo;The war metaphor, the war paradigm or model for thinking about arguments, has, I think, deforming effects on how we argue. First, it elevates tactics over substance. You can take a class in logic, argumentation. You learn all about the subterfuges that people use to try and win arguments \u0026ndash; the false steps. It magnifies the us-versus them aspect of it. It makes it adversarial; it\u0026rsquo;s polarizing. And the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph \u0026ndash; glorious triumph \u0026ndash; or abject, ignominious defeat. I think those are deforming effects, and worst of all, it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise or collaboration.\u0026rdquo;\n How might we use argument-as-proof to help others (and ourselves) recognize tenets of social justice dogma?

It\u0026rsquo;s a shared space that we\u0026rsquo;re actively co-creating together.\nIn order to take SJMD IRL, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to do something similar: create a space for your real community to work through all the issues that resonated with you throughout this course.\nA meetspace, if you will, that will likely combine elements of cyberspace and physical space, for your community to exist in this way.\nThroughout this Module, we\u0026rsquo;ll be talking about what that might look like, how the different Modules so far might frame your efforts, and providing some examples of how people are already doing this in their communities.\n"},{"uri":"https://irl.course.sjmd.space/barks-like-a-dogma/","title":"Barks Like a Dogma","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Module 6 Barks Like a Dogma IRL How can we take what we covered in Barks Like a Dogma and apply it IRL?\n"},{"uri":"https://irl.course.sjmd.space/barks-like-a-dogma/derailing-arguments-as-war/","title":"Derailing Arguments (as War)","tags":[],"description":"","content":"A lot of us are uncomfortable with arguments, because we have only seen them in the adversarial context.

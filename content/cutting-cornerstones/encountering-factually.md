We want to make sure that we're focusing our efforts on the parts of SJD that matter the most. And in talking about SJMD with others IRL, whenever we mention a Cornerstone of SJD, we'll likely encounter pushback.

Counterfactuals -- both walking someone through our own reasoning here, and inviting them to share theirs with us -- are a great way to move forward.

```
Practice working through a meaningful counterfactual with someone in your life that you haven't talked to about SJD (or SJMD). Ask them for their input on one of the Cornerstones of SJD that's on your mind, or some other tenet or idea related to social justice dogma (or just SJ in general) that you're wrestling with. The other tools we've mentioned (the facilitation concepts and argument-as-proof) might come in handy.

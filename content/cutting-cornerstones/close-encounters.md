While completing that fieldwork, or in any conversation you've had that utilized counterfactuals, things might have gotten intense -- or been on the verge of something like that, unraveling, falling apart, or blowing up.

This is one of the risks of counterfactuals: because we can't ultimately _know_ whether the alternative is true (we're imagining a world that doesn't exist), a shouting match or "let's agree to disagree" are possible, likely outcomes.

Our next tool will help in those situations, giving us a better shot of using counterfactuals beneficially, avoiding meltdowns and close encounters with community implosion.

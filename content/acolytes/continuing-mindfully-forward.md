Mindfulness is a muscle we develop through practice. The more often we practice it, the more often we notice when we're not doing it, when we're not mindful (i.e., when we're on "autopilot").

And while that might seem small, it's actually massive.

That alone -- the ability for us to notice when we're _not_ being mindful -- will help immeasurably as we take steps forward to bring SJMD IRL.

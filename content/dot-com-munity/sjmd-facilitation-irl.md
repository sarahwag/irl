In what ways do you see yourself starting to create a real community to address SJD? How might facilitation, or just those two key concepts, help?

```
Call your accountabilibuddy (and/or open up a journal and grab your pen), and revisit the main highlights of the Dot-Com-Munity Module that stuck out to you, in this new context of applying them in your real life, for creating real community to confront SJD in your world. What seems easy? Do-able? What seems challenging? Impossible?
```

Keep this conversation, and these two facilitation concepts, in the back of your mind as we present the other tools and revisit the rest of the SJMD Modules.

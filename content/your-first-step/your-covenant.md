As a commitment to your community, and to us -- the community we've invested our time, energy, and efforts to co-create here -- we invite you to create a covenant:

**One single action -- as big and bold as you decide -- that you commit to taking after you complete this course, to move us closer to living social justice, and to help us dismantle the dogma that is obstructing our path.**

<small>If you share this with us (the course facilitators), we'll privately follow-up with you (in whatever way you choose, whenever you choose) to check in on your progress. Reply below if you're up for this.</small>

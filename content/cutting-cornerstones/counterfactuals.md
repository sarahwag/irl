Spending a little more time in Philosophy Land, we have found the tool of counterfactuals to be super helpful for cutting cornerstones.

Put simply, a "counterfactual" a statement (or the start of an arguement-as-proof) that "If X wasn't true, Y would be." We often use counterfactuals in our day-to-day conversations or thinking without realizing it.

Here's a video that walks through counterfactuals in more depth (sorry in advance for the font), and a (super jargon-laden) philosophical explanation of counterfactuals:

<small>What use can you imagine we might have for counterfactuals in SJMD conversations? How might they help us with "Cutting Cornerstones"? To put it another way: If we don't utilize counterfactuals, how might SJD prevail? ðŸ˜‰</small>

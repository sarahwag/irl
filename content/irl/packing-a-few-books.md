If this were a flight, here are the books we'd recommend you stow in your carry-on:

- {{% icon read %}} [BOOK: Braving the Wilderness / Bren√© Brown](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34565022-braving-the-wilderness)
- {{% icon read %}} [BOOK: Team Human / Daniel Rushkoff](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40180066-team-human)

Unlike the other books we've referenced so far in the course, there's not a single passage, chapter, or excerpt from either of these books we'll be connecting to a particular topic. Instead, they are, in their entirety, useful for everything we'll be talking about from here on out.

So while they're not technically required reading (as much as everything else linked so far isn't), we can't recommend them enough -- we think you'll love them. They're SJMD IRL jet fuel.

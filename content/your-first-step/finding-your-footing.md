With all of the Modules of the course in mind (from creating community, to recognizing dogma and fundamentalism, to the acolytes and our theses)...

And all of the tools we've presented in this Module in mind (facilitation, argument-as-proof, counterfactuals, mindfulness, and design thinking)...

And with your unique world, meetspace, IRL in mind...

```
Figure out the first step you're going to take to advance Living Social Justice, and unravel SJD, after you complete this course. Make it actionable (you'll know when it's done), and think about it as being the first in a sequence of actions. We invite you to make this as big and scary or small and simple as you're feeling ready, compelled, or able to make it.

Here's how we see it: when it comes to creating real community, there is a lot at stake, a lot that can go wrong, and few ways to do it right. But one thing is for sure: **you need to create a space where everyone can show up, be seen, and see one another**.

If you can do that, you might be able to move on to establishing interdependence, mutual support, challenging biases, norm-setting, and revolutionizing language.

**The framework of "Both/And > Or/But"** helps us recognize when it's possible for two realities, two stories, or two differing perspectives to stand side-by-side.

**And creating "Safe Spaces for Vulnerability"** is necessary for mitigating the fallout from talking about risky, loaded, no-clear-right-answer-but-lots-of-"wrong"-answers topics, which perfectly describes SJD (and SJMD) conversations.

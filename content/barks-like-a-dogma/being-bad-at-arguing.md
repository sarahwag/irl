Most of us are bad at arguing.

We might be bad because we [argue fallaciously](http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html), trying so hard to "win" in an argument-of-war that we undermine the integrity of the conversation we're having. For the sake of SJMD, this is something we need to avoid at all costs.

We might also be bad at arguing because we lose arguments a lot. Because we realize, through an argument-as-proof, that our idea wasn't rooted in truth. That something we thought was a tenet of SJD, for example, wasn't. This is the kind of bad we need to get good at.

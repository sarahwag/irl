We have covered _a lot_ of ground in this course.

In (no fewer than) 6 weeks, we've spanned about a dozen disciplines, linked to several-fold that number of chapters and articles and essays and videos and podcasts, inspected SJD from every angle, proposed a foundation for SJMD, and now we have a few tools we might as we construct that foundation.

Let's just acknowledge the amount-ness of that: how many dots we have at our disposal for connecting.

(Maybe now would be a good time for a 1 minute mindfulness practice session ðŸ˜˜)

If we allow ourselves to be burdened by the weight of creating the perfect thing -- whatever that thing might be (e.g., a curriculum, brown bag lunch program, community discussion series, essay, or Facebook post) -- we're more likely to go nowhere (perfectly) than we are to go anywhere.

If we hold others to standards of perfect when they are creating things for social justice, we're shouldering them with the same burden, as well as anyone looking on, who sees that the bar to entry is perfection -- an impossible bar to clear.

What would it look like if we made this as easy as possible?

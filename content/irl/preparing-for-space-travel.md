To prepare you to move this conversation from SJMD.space to your personal meetspace, we're going to revisit each Module from the course: [Dot-Com-Munity,](https://dotcommunity.course.sjmd.space) [Barks Like a Dogma,](https://barkslikeadogma.course.sjmd.space) [Cutting Cornerstones,](https://cornerstones.course.sjmd.space) [The Acolytes,](https://acolytes.course.sjmd.space) and [Theses Pieces](https://thesespieces.course.sjmd.space).

Having a "social justice" conversation requires a certain set of tools: skills, mindsets, beliefs, passions, etc. Having a "social justice, minus dogma" conversation requires those and a few more.

As we revisit each Module, we'll furnish you with a tool that might help.

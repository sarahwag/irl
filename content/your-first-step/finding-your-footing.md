With all of the Modules of the course in mind (from creating community, to recognizing dogma and fundamentalism, to the acolytes and our theses)...

Plus all of the tools we've presented in this Module (facilitation, argument-as-proof, counterfactuals, mindfulness, and design thinking)...

Add in your unique world, meetspace, IRL, knowing who you are, and the skills and talents and gifts you have to offer...

And finally, if you've been reading _Team Human_ or _Braving the Wilderness_, add whatever you've gleaned from those books into the mix...

**Take as much time as you need to complete this final fieldwork** ðŸ‘‡

```
Figure out the first step you're going to take to advance Living Social Justice, and unravel SJD, after you complete this course. Make it actionable (you'll know when it's done), and think about it as being the first in a sequence of actions. We invite you to make this as big and scary or small and simple as you're feeling ready, compelled, or able to make it.

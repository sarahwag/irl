And we've by no means turned over every stone.

For every essay we linked, there were 3 others we could have instead. For every chapter of a book we recommended, there's the rest of the book that would likely benefit us all to read. And so on.

This course might be coming to an end for you, but by no means is SJMD over. It's just getting started.

Just like we had an "Orientation" Module, you'll get the chance to go through "Graduation", where we'll talk about some of the opportunities we have to address these unturned stones in the future.

For now, **we hope you feel the inklings of comfort with what it takes to create real community, identify social justice dogma, root out the foundational beliefs that allow it to thrive, recognize all of our roles in reinforcing dogmatic fundamentalism, name alternatives to SJD in the form of living social justice, and take all of that and beginning to apply it in your real life.**
